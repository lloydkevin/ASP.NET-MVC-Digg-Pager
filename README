ASP.NET MVC has no built in pagin support. After searching for for a while, I came across this sample:
http://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/2008/08/27/paging-with-aspnet-mvc/
from Martin Boland

He has since expanded this for MVC 2: https://github.com/martijnboland/MvcPaging/commits/mvc2

This was perfect for what I needed, except I couldn't figure out a way to make it play nice with already existing query strings.


I soon after came across the built in pager in the MVCContrib library 
http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Grid&referringTitle=Documentation

But their paging was quite boring (first, last, current page, etc).


So I decided to combine the two approaches and came up with what I have now. MvcContrib already handled Paging an IEnumerable and even sorting.
I decided to run with this and modify they way it outputs to look like Martin's Digg style.

Hope this helps.
